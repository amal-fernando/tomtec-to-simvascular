# SimVascular Input Automation from TomTec Echocardiography Data

## Overview
This project automates the preparation of input files for SimVascular simulations using 4D echocardiographic data exported from TomTec. It streamlines the conversion, preprocessing, and formatting steps to enable patient-specific cardiovascular computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.

## Features
- Converts raw TomTec echocardiographic data into simulation-ready formats
- Automates generation of geometry and boundary condition files for SimVascular
- Facilitates reproducible and efficient CFD workflow for cardiovascular research

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
